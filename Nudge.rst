========================
A choice architect is someone who "has the responsibility for organizing the context in which people make decisions." (pg. 16) Our policy and law makers are an example of a choice architect as they have the power to affect people's choices based on the policies that they implement. These choice architects can either apply a subtle or major influence on how the people would make their decision. 

A policy is considered "paternalistic" if it attempts to influence a person to choose an action(or inaction) that would make them better off. The term "better off", however, is judged by the policy maker. This is a contreversial topic because one side argues that this is a clear violation of their freedom to choose. 

Deterrence is the use of punishment as a threat to deter people from offending.
